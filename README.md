# VulnerabiltyManagementProject

### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

   In this lab we are going to be doing a vulnerability management lab using Tenable along with Azure VM. But first I want to 
   explain what is a Vulnerablity Management and what it is used for. Vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of 
   identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating" software vulnerabilities. Businesses use vulnerability management to help
   reduce organizational risk by modifying sofeware vulnerabilites discovered in a production enviornment. A vulnerability is a 
   weakness exploitable by attackers to to compromise systems or date like a) Out of date 3rd party software (ie; Firefox etc.) 
   b)Out of date OS (ie Windows Updates; etc) c)Misconfigurations (No passwards, airdrop being open)
